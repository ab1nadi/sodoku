Just a fun little website, that generates sudoku puzzles of any difficulty. To understand how to create such a website I heavily referenced the paper, "Sudoku Puzzles Generating: from Easy to Evil." The paper can be found with this link: http://zhangroup.aporc.org/images/files/Paper_3485.pdf. This paper generally outlines the basic algorithm for creating sudoku puzzles of any difficulty from Easy to Evil, and gives no code.
