# Building the project
I didn't use any frameworks for this project but I did use the webpack bundler. So the index.html page just uses the dist.js that is generated by the bundler.
To bundle the javascript go the the project directory in commmand prompt and then run npx webpack.

* cd project/directory
* npx webpack
